# WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER
>## Introduction
With using World Development Explorer we try to find out about life expectancy , comparing the countries in accordance with population. It is important to know how health issues impact the life expectancy.Why is life expectancy is less ? How to improve it?Can we improve it by reducing polution and having healthy food?
Based on the world development explorer, finding out the health issue and food improvement.A Problem Analysis investigates a situation/problem in order to allow the researcher to understand more fully the problem, in order to recommend practical solutions for solving it.In addition, a Problem Analysis determines the degree of the problem and if the problem is a genuinely related to the specific site under investigated.
According to World Development Explorer we try to find out similarities and differences between four different countries seleted from different regions such as India,Bangladesh, Unites States and Germany.

In our first analysis we see life expectancy at birth versus GDP(current US $) with respect to total population.Population comparing with the country wise.
India has the highest population as well as GDP of less then 1.7T and life expectancy between 65-70 years.United states has highest GDP around 14T and life expectancy of 79 years.Germany population is less compared to other countries. And life expectancy is 81 years and GDP is between 3.3T.Bangladesh has less GDP compared to other countries around 115B and life expectancy is 70 years.

Gross Domestic Product is increasing each year for India. And the population also with life expectancy is increasing also.Compared to other countries in 2018 ,Bangladesh has the highest GDP increase of 44.6%.India is second GDP percentage of 33.2 %.United States is 15.8% GDP.And Germany is least increase of 6.38% increase in GDP.
