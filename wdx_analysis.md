# WORLD DEVELOPMENT EXPLORER
>## Introduction
With using World Development Explorer we try to find out about life expectancy , comparing the countries in accordance with population. It is important to know how health issues impact the life expectancy.Why is life expectancy is less ? How to improve it?Can we improve it by reducing polution and having healthy food?
Based on the world development explorer, finding out the health issue and food improvement.A Problem Analysis investigates a situation/problem in order to allow the researcher to understand more fully the problem, in order to recommend practical solutions for solving it.In addition, a Problem Analysis determines the degree of the problem and if the problem is a genuinely related to the specific site under investigated.
According to World Development Explorer we try to find out similarities and differences between four different countries seleted from different regions such as India,Bangladesh, Unites States and Germany.

In our first analysis we see life expectancy at birth versus GDP(current US $) with respect to total population.Population comparing with the country wise.
India has the highest population as well as GDP of less then 10k and life expectancy between 65-70 years.United states has highest GDP around 48-50k and life expectancy of 79 years.Germany population is less compared to other countries. And life expectancy is 81 years and GDP is between 38-40k.Bangladesh has less GDP compared to other countries around 1-2k and life expectancy is 70 years.
